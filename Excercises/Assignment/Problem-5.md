# Problem Context
Write a program called SumAverageRunningInt which computes the sum and average of running integers from a lowerbound (For eg 1) to an upperbound using loop (For eg 100) 

## Problem Summary
- Write a program called SumAverageRunningInt which prints the sum and average of running integers from a lowerbound to an upperbound
  - LOWERBOUND integer value is 1
  - UPPERBOUND integer value is 100
  - Print the value as. The sum of 1 to 100 is 5050
  - The average is 50.5

## Dev Notes
- Create a new class called SumAverageRunningInt.
- Create a lower bound final integer value as 1
- Create an upper bound final integer value as 100
- Use double variable type for sum and average
- Implement the above logic and print the sum and average
