# Problem Context
Write a program called PrintNumberInWord which prints the number in word for any number with value <=5


## Problem Summary
- Write a program called PrintNumberInWord which prints the number in word for any number with value <=5
  - Prints "ONE" if the int variable "number" is 1
  - Prints "TWO" if the int variable "number" is 2
  - Prints "THREE" if the int variable "number" is 3
  - Prints "FOUR" if the int variable "number" is 4
  - Prints "FIVE" if the int variable "number" is 5

## Dev Notes
- Create a new class called PrintNumberInWord.
- Create int variable named number which can have a value <=5
- Implement the above logic
- Try changing the `variable number` value and check if the program prints correctly
