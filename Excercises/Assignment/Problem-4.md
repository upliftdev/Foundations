## Problem Summary
- Write a program called PrintDayInWord which prints the day based on number using switch case
  - Prints "Sunday" if the int variable `number` is 0
  - Prints "Monday" if the int variable `number` is 1
  - Prints "Tuesday" if the int variable `number` is 2
  - Prints "Wednesday" if the int variable `number` is 3

  - Prints "Friday" if the int variable `number` is 5
  - Prints "Saturday" if the int variable `number` is 6
  - Prints "Invalid Day" if the int variable `number` does not match any of the above conditions

- Create a new class called PrintNumberInWord.
- Create a int variable named number which can have a value <=5
- Implement the above logic
- Try changing the `variable number` value and check if the program prints correctly
