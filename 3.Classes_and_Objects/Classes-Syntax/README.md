# Classes: Syntax

## Shop

1. In a code editor, create a ```public``` ```Store``` class.

2. Your program will not compile without a ```main()``` method.

	Define one within ```Store```.

Example code can be found in the [Store.Java](https://github.com/upliftdev/Foundations/blob/main/Foundations/3.Classes_and_Objects/Classes-Syntax/src/main/java/com/examples/classes5/Store.java) file.
