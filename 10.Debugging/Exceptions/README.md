# Exceptions

1. Start with this code

```
public class Debug {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    int width = 0;
    int length = 40;
    
    int ratio = length / width;
        
  }
  
}
```

2. Put the code that you think will cause an ```ArithmeticException``` into a ```try``` block.

	Create a ```catch``` block that catches the ```ArithmeticException``` and prints the error message to the terminal.

Example solution can be found in the [Debug.java](https://github.com/upliftdev/Foundations/blob/main/Foundations/10.Debugging/Exceptions/src/main/java/com/examples/debug/Debug.java) file
